                    <h2>Medellin</h2>
                <p>Raft Rioverde and Samana river, a clear green river that carves through untouched Colombian rainforest. Start the adventure in Medellin and drive for 2 hours to San Francisco Municipallity, via Medellin-Bogota highway. After we drive 40 minutes until Boqueron and then we start a 40 minutes class 3 hiking until river through an amazin canyon, once in the river, we prepare the boats for the raft in this cristalline river for 5 hours with class III/IV rapids and beautiful waterfalls. We make a stop for taking lunch and enjoy the river, then we continue with the rafting activity until we arrive to our finish point in the bridge of Samana river. This rafting experience is beyond just paddling whitewater, it’s a fascinating journey into the heart of Colombia’s most untouched rainforest.
