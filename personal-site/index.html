                        The most recent health crisis transformed our daily lives, let us to understand that being productive does not attract us to an office, or that our place of residence prevents us from accessing different job or training offers, on the contrary, it showed
                        us that we can make more appropriate use of our time from the comfort of home. This situation really altered our daily life, we tried not to have physical contact, which let us to use technological means to carry out tasks that
                        we previously did in simpler ways, such as paying with contactless methods through our mobile devices, we resorted to make purchases through different applications or platforms and in this way continue with our lives in the most
                        normal way possible, we limit our interactions with other people and although this is not emotionally healthy, it did show us that there were other ways of performing daily tasks ; the problem was that, but not all of us were prepared
                        for this situation, which is why for many it was a disruptive change, which brought chaos to our lives, but in the midst of chaos many opportunities arise and no solution arises without first presenting a need , today it is a necessity
                        to be able to know about technology to be able to take advantage of the benefits it brings to our lives.
