        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>I am a systems engineer, technology enthusiast, with more than 10 years of experience in programming, I have had the opportunity to work for several multinationals, in the development area; But when I entered the wonderful world of software, I
            did not know which way to go since there are many paths (Support, databases, infrastructure, back-end development, front-end development, etc.) and as the days go by the possibilities grow, that is why We want to help you understand the different
            areas better and help you make the best decision for your future. Here you will find programming courses in different programming languages, design patterns, good practices, but architecture as on-premises as cloud, databases, technological
            trends, etc., starting all from scratch, so that you can clearly understand and acquire the tools necessary to carry out your projects.</p>

        <p>
            The most recent health crisis transformed our daily lives, let us to understand that being productive does not attract us to an office, or that our place of residence prevents us from accessing different job or training offers, on the contrary, it showed
            us that we can make more appropriate use of our time from the comfort of home. This situation really altered our daily life, we tried not to have physical contact, which let us to use technological means to carry out tasks that we previously
            did in simpler ways, such as paying with contactless methods through our mobile devices, we resorted to make purchases through different applications or platforms and in this way continue with our lives in the most normal way possible, we
            limit our interactions with other people and although this is not emotionally healthy, it did show us that there were other ways of performing daily tasks ; the problem was that, but not all of us were prepared for this situation, which is
            why for many it was a disruptive change, which brought chaos to our lives, but in the midst of chaos many opportunities arise and no solution arises without first presenting a need , today it is a necessity to be able to know about technology
            to be able to take advantage of the benefits it brings to our lives.
